## 💡 Use Case Example:

Imagine you're planning a trip with friends. One of you sets up a ledger named "China Trip", adds others as collaborators, and everyone contributes their expenses in real-time.
With AI-assistance and a shared dashboard, Spendora helps keep everyone on the same page—literally.

git clone https://github.com/HelpMeCodePls/bookkeeping-ai.git
cd bookkeeping-ai
```

### 2. Set Up the Frontend
